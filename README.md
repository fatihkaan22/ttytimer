ttytimer is a fork of tty-clock by xorg62 which modifies the
original project to be a timer, as the name suggests.

```
usage : ttytimer [-xbvih] [-C [0-7]] hh:mm:ss
        -x            Show box
        -C [0-7]      Set the clock color
        -b            Use bold colors
        -v            Show ttytimer version
        -h            Show this page
```

TODO:
1. Option to count up rather than just down.
1. Sound on 00:00:00.
1. Symbolic names for colours rather than 0-7.
1. Man page - including detailed description of time format.
