ttytimer is a fork of tty-clock by xorg62 which modifies the
original project to be a timer, as the name suggests.

## Usage

```
usage : %s [-xbvih] [-C color] hh:mm:ss
        -x            Show box
        -C color      Set the clock color
           color  ==  black | red | green
                      | yellow | blue | magenta
                      | cyan | white
        -b            Use bold colors
        -v            Show ttytimer version
        -h            Show this page
```
